		<content>&lt;b&gt;Ordered hookups are here!&lt;/b&gt;\n\nExtremely similar to the forced romance attempts added with Biotech, you can now order your colonists to attempt a hookup. (Biotech is not required for this feature.) There is a 20% increase to acceptance of an ordered hookup. This is multiplicative, so a success chance of 0% won't be affected.\n\nSettings can be added by race modders to limit how their race uses this system. This includes a minimum opinion requirement, breeding only, trait requirements, or disabling it altogether.\n\nAlong with this update there are some new user settings.\n\nFertility Mod: If you have a mod that adds pregnancy (including Biotech) please set it here. Some of these mods can be used together, and I need to know which one is actually handling fertility. If your mod is not on the list, please let me know what mod you're using on steam or github.\n\nAdd joy need to slaves and/or prisoners. Having a joy need is a requirement for regular hookups. So if you want your slaves or prisoners to hook up with each other, use these settings to give them a joy need. If you change the setting while playing, you'll need to reload the save for it to take effect.</content>
